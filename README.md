# ezLife AutoIn
The most easiest [Anime i.ntere.st](http://i.ntere.st) bot ever made. It is a cross-browser (Firefox/Chrome/Safari) extension that automates the process of +in-ing. We don't plan to ruin Anime i.ntere.st, we just want to help people earn points.

## Installation
Soon.

## Development Setup

### Requirements
1. Install Python 2.7 (http://www.python.org/download/).
2. Download the Kango Framework then extract it to any directory (http://kangoextensions.com/kango.html).

Before you start, if you're using Windows OS, you can make a Path System Variable. This will make the compilation of the project a lot easier.
On the start menu, search and open 'Advance System Settings'. Click on 'Environment Variables'. On the system variables, choose 'Path' then click the edit button. Click the 'Home' button on your keyboard then write the following
```
C:\Path\To\Kango Framework;
```
Be sure to edit the location where you extracted the Kango Framework.

Clone this repository to get the updated code.

### Compiling
Open the CLI (Command Line Interface) then execute the following
```
kango.py build C:\Path\To\Project
```
Also change the path where you put the project's code.
